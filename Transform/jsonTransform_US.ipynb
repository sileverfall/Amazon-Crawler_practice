After contacting Amazon about the problem, they overnighted me a Gund Elmo. This actually gives a nice perspective on the differences between them.Comparing the two:The non-Gund has hard eyes, a very soft and fluffy coat, and an open mouth (one you could open and close by pinching his \"lips\" together). The Gund has soft eyes, more of a shag coat, and a flat piece of black felt for the mouth (giving the illusion of depth in the stock photo but there actually is no \"inside\" to his mouth - its just a half circle black felt cutout sewn to his face). For me, it was more important to have soft eyes than the mouth situation, so it doesn\\'t bother me. I just want my daughter to be able to snuggle with it at night. The Gund Elmo is also shorter, by about two inches. However, the quality seems great on both. Neither Elmo seems disproportionate to me, as some others have mentioned. The non-Gund probably looks a bit more like the \"real\" Elmo, but there is no mistaking who either of them are.',\n",

She recognizes the name when I ask if she wants her Elmo.It's light weight and very soft and not too large for an infant.
